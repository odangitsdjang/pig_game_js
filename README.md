Learning Javascript: Writing a pig game -- David Jang
----
1. I wrote the logic of the pig game, connecting the DOMs together
2. I was given the front end files (html, css, png).
3. From Udemy JavaScript course! But I wrote the logic myself, not from the course.
4. A lot of the logic is inefficient as I'm still learning JavaScript: I'm on my first week in JS!
